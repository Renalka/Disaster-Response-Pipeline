# Udacity Project2
# Disaster Response Pipeline

This project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Figure Eight. The dataset provided by Figure Eight contains pre-labelled tweet and messages from real-life disasters. The project is aimed at using ML and building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to categorize these messages on a real time basis.


This project has the following sections:

Processing data, building an ETL pipeline, cleaning the data and saving it in a SQLite database

Building a machine learning pipeline to train a model which can classify the messages into various categories

Running a web app which can be used to visualise the results in real time
